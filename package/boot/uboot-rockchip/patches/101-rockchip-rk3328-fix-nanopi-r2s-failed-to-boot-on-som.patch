Subject: [PATCH] rockchip: rk3328: fix nanopi-r2s failed to boot on some sd cards

Issues:
When booting on some SD cards an error message appears as:
"spl: mmc init failed with error: -95"

Solutions:
Add regulator-boot-on parameters to vcc_sd.
Add startup-delay-us parameters to vcc_sdio.
This will improve the problem that in some SD cards are failing to boot up.

Tested environment:
SD Card: Netac Extreme P500 Pro 32GB
